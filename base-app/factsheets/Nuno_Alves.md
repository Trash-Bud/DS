# Factsheet for Nuno Alves
## Sprint 0

With the collaboration of all team 3 members, we wrote and made mockups for the base app issues and user stories.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#1 - As a User, I want to be able to toggle in between the multiple microservices, so that I may access their services when needed](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/issues/1)
- [#2 - As User, I want to be able to log in so that I have access to the rest of the base app.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/issues/2)


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- No PRs were made in this sprint.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of


## Sprint 1

Developed the dashboard, along with [Miguel Freitas](https://github.com/Poodlers), using a modular design that makes it easy to add new service endpoints to the dashboard without altering code, using a JSON solution. The end result closely matches the given mockups, with fluid animation and a responsive design. The solution was properly tested using both unit tests and widget tests.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [#23 - Add dashboard](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/pull/23)
- [#16 - Add openable dashboard drawer with icons](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/pull/16)

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

- Discovering and fixing errors related to frontend file assets in the dev and production docker containers.


## Sprint 2

Developed the frontend for the sales channels brand configs with a responsive design, using Flutter Providers which allows for easy decoupling of model controllers and the frontend widgets. The end result closely matches the given mockups. The solution was properly tested using both unit tests and widget tests. 

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#14 - As a brand, I want to check my "Sales Channels & Fulfilment Type" configurations so that I can be informed on what sale channels I have active and their fulfillment types](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/14)
- [#10 - As an admin, I want to check brand configurations so that I can be informed on how their fulfilments are processed.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/10)


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [#34 - Display the dropdown of configuration tabs and make it responsive to width changes](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/pull/34)
- [#35 - As a brand, I want to check my "Sales Channels & Fulfilment Type" configurations so that I can be informed on what sale channels I have active and their fulfillment types](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/pull/35)

## Sprint 3

Continued the development of the brand configs micro-service by creating a connection between the frontend and backend for editing sale channels fulfilments. This was done with a modular Repository system that can be mocked for testing. 

I also contributed to the design system repository with a modular and highly configurable switch widget that conforms to the MAERSK design system.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#17 - As an admin, I want to check a brand's "Sales Channels & Fulfilment Type" configurations so that I can be informed on what sale channels they have active and their fulfillment types"](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/17)
- [#2 - As a user I want the switch inputs across micro services to be consistent, so that the design is easier to understand](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/design-system/issues/2)

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [#69 - Add using backend api to display fulfilment channels](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/pull/69)
- [#4 - Add a switch widget](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/design-system/pull/4)

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

- Contributed to the design system
- Discovering and fixing errors on the deployment actions for the base-app ([Micro-service JSON stored in wrong path](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/pull/64)) and brand-configs
