## Sprint 1

Together with [Homailot](https://github.com/Homailot), I worked on the user stories regarding the [base app](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app),
mostly on its frontend, having helped create the Dashboard. I also helped review and correct some of my colleague's unit tests that were not working. The end results match closely with the mockups. This was properly tested with unit tests.

As the scrum master for team 3, I made an effort to keep up with the progress of the rest of my team members and attempted to ensure their work went smoothly by scheduling meetings during the Sprint.
