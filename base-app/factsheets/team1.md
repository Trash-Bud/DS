# Factsheet for Team 1 

## Sprint 0

Our team created and estimated most of the user stories in the [Inbound](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound) microservice (frontend and backend). Furthermore, we helped in the creation of the Inbound's UML.

In this sprint, the class developed a template for all the futures microservices, with two `Hello World` apps: a backend developed in C# and .NET and a frontend made in Flutter. Our team participated in the setup meeting and helped setting up the template and GitHub Actions CI.

Additionally, our team's SPO had several meetings with the PO in order to understand and discuss the project's requirements.


### The four user stories that we are most proud of

## Sprint 1

In the planning of this sprint, we estimated the user stories created in sprint 0 and distributed work based on the user points assigned. We also created a work item meant to setup the initial structure of the microsservice we're focusing on, the [Inbound](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound).

During the sprint, our team finished most of the planned tasks and we managed to do code reviews which lead to some improvements. We believe our changes have good value for the clients, considering this was the first sprint.
