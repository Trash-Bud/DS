# Factsheet for Nuno Costa

## Sprint 0

In this Sprint, aside from actively helping to define the project structure in the classes - in particular, defining the component diagram -, I also wrote several user stories for the Brand Configurations microservice, ensuring that the requirements were well defined, wrote part of the development guide for the project and helped setting a baseline for future mockups on a class shared Figma file.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

Most of my contributions were made in group, since a lot of the workload for this sprint was to discuss and define work strategies, diagrams and documentation. However, there are some evidences:

 * [To change a brand's policies for e-fulfillment](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/2)
 * [To change the warehouses that store a brand's products](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/3)


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None were made during this sprint.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

 * Defined the [branching strategy and commit guidelines](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/blob/main/docs/development.md) for the project.
 * Assisted with the [baseline mockup design](https://www.figma.com/team_invite/redeem/hb2CR8jJDJT47ixioze7qW).

## Sprint 1

During this sprint, I helped setting up Kafka. We managed to find a good solution for this service, so that it can be used by all microservices present in our system. Even though it was a difficult Sprint timewise due to some other personal motives, I still tried to engage with the team and help them in any way I could.

### The user story that I am most proud of

Since the work was mostly based on kafka setup, I did not finish any user story this sprint.

### The pull request that I am most proud of

* #24 [Setup Kafka]([https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/pull/24](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/pull/24)

### Other contributions that I am especially proud of

Helped the team follow the guidelines, for a more strucutured and well-organized project.

## Sprint 2

Since the Kafka development was limited, I helped other teams completing some of their issues. As such, I ended up working on the inbound service, particularly in the ASN booking and cancelation, both in the frontend display and backend management.

### The user story that I am most proud of

* #10 [As a user, I want to cancel an ASN, so that I can stop it in case I need to](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/issues/10)

### The pull request that I am most proud of

* #24 [feature/cancel-asn](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/pull/57)

### Other contributions that I am especially proud of

Helped other teams (especially team 1) in the development of the inbound service.

## Sprint 3

For this sprint, my main focus was on developing a working implementation of the Kafka Message Service. For this, I helped developing the underlying framework, designed the model for the "ReceptionReceived" payload and created some sample displays for the "ReceptionCreated" payload send/receive functions, in order to show that it is working as intended.

### The user story that I am most proud of

- #14 [As an administrator of the service, I want to receive a ReceptionReceived message in KAFKA, so that the PO status is updated](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/issues/14)

### The pull requests that I am most proud of

- #81 [feature/kafka-receptionreceived](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/pull/81)
- #94 [feature/kafka-message-frontend](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/pull/94)

### Other contributions that I am especially proud of

- I communicated efficiently with the remaining teams, to accelerate development
- I contributed significantly to the overall sprint retrospective
- I made several reviews that helped avoid bottlenecks in adding functionality to the final product
