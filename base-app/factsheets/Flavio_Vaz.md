With team 2, I participated in the creation of user stories for the project catalog.

I participated in the creation of mockups for the user stories where I was more involved.

Contributed to the creation of the template common to all teams, namely writing the Market Research.



### The two user stories that I am most proud of

<!--This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed. -->
I created the acceptance tests and helped to do mockups for the user stories listed below.

 * [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/4) - As an admin, I want to search in the catalog so that I can obtain products according to my information needs.
 * [#6](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/6) - As a brand, I want to search in the catalog so that I can obtain products of my brand according to my information needs.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

<!--This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint. -->

 None were done in this sprint.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

<!-- This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library. -->

Participation in PO meetings as SPO, creation of a first draft of user stories used in the practical class.


## Sprint 1

With team 2, in this sprint I essentially participated in the development of the user story [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8) focusing on work item [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/21) .


I also contributed with some tasks as SPO, but for reasons of force majeure (worker-student) I was not able to participate in the meeting with the PO before the end of the sprint.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8) - As a brand, I want to import a list of products in a .xlsx file so that I can insert products in the catalog that are already listed in a template format.
 - Contributed to the development of this user story and some work items ( [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/21) ) associated with it .  


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

<!--This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint. -->

Commits to the user story and work item mentioned above have been made. But no pull request was made regarding work item [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/21) and user story [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8), since what was developed was not ready yet, and we were at the very top of the deployment phase. A pull request was made to update the factsheet for sprint 1 .


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

<!-- This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library. -->

With colleagues who worked on the same user story and work item, I contributed to solving some technical flaws and lack of knowledge in the use of flutter. Which will later help to accelerate the development of user story [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8) among others.


## Sprint 2

With team 2, in this sprint I essentially participated in the development of the user story [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8) focusing on work items [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/21),and the merge ([#70](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/70) ) into develop that closed user storie [8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8) .

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8) - As a brand, I want to import a list of products in a .xlsx file so that I can insert products in the catalog that are already listed in a template format.
 - This is a user story that came from sprint 1 and that proves to be relatively laborious both on the frontend and on the backend.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

 * [#70](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/70) Feature/import xlsx
   - This is the PR that merges to develop and closes the user story [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8), that consistes on the implementation of the backend and frontend in a page that allows the user to pick a file by dropping it into a dropzone or by searching it in the file explorer.
   - Also, in this PR in collaboration with other colleagues from team 2, having as main contributor the teamate [Henrique](https://github.com/Rikenunes8), a significant refactor and conflicts resolution was done, so that we can merge with develop correctly.

 * [#67](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/67) Feature/send file 
   - This is the PR that closes the work items [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/21) and [#22](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/22)
   - [António](https://github.com/Antjcmiranda) and I were having problems integrating the frontend with a post request, in order to send the file in a correct format to the backend, so that the parse developed in the backend works with minimal refactor on backend side. Here [Henrique](https://github.com/Rikenunes8) proved to be a very collaborative teammate, where he helped us in various ways and clarified several doubts about flutter (our experience with flutter is minimal).


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

- I contributed with some ideas regarding some details adding products/variants from the .xlsx file to the database, avoiding for example repeated products/variants and how to treat fields with nulls.
- Whenever I was asked for help, I tried to help as best I could at any time of day. I have always accepted advice and guidance from my teammates who have been very collaborative and have taught me a lot. Also, having found that my working-student hours had become impossible to combine with meetings with the PO, I reported this fact and immediately suggested and fully accepted my replacement as SPO. [Catarina](https://github.com/catarinaopires) is currently doing an excellent job in the SPO role.

## Sprint 3

With team 2, in this sprint I essentially participated in the development of user stories #4 and #6 and in the integration and resolution of conflicts with the Catalog pagination functionality that was added in this sprint.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of


[#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/4) - As an admin, I want to search in the catalog so that I can obtain products according to my information needs.

[#6](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/6) - As a brand, I want to search in the catalog so that I can obtain products of my brand according to my information needs.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

[#99](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/99) and [#100](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/100) - These are the pull requests that close the work items [#94](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/100) and [#95](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/95) that will allow adding the functionality of a search engine to the catalogue.

[#103](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/103) - This is the pull request that closes user stories [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/4) and [#6](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/6) when merging to develop, resolving various conflicts and integration with catalog pagination.
...

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

I made a considerable effort to improve my knowledge of the technologies used mainly flutter nd some knowledge about C# on the backend. With that I was able to develop my tasks more autonomously and help resolve conflicts. 

Although in the end, for now, we decided not to use circular progression enchancement while waiting for the search engine to return, it is something that, when it makes sense, in the future can be easily integrated into the catalog.
