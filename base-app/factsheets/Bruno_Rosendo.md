# Factsheet for Bruno Rosendo

## Sprint 0

Alongside my team, I helped create, estimate and assign the [Inbound](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound)'s user stories. As the scrum master, I scheduled a few meetings for the development of the user stories and related discussions.

In this sprint, the class developed a template for all the futures microsservices, with two `Hello World` apps: a backend developed in C# and .NET and a frontend made in Flutter. I participated in the group programming and helped setting up the GitHub Actions CI.
