# Factsheet for Jos√© Ferreira

## Sprint 0

Alongside my team, I helped create, estimate and assign the [Inbound](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound)'s user stories. As the Surrogate Product Owner (SPO), I was in constant communication with the Product Owner (PO), via e-mails and meetings alongside the other SPOs. This way, we were able to get a more clear vision of the product wanted by the PO and got access to some important files that helped us in the creation of the user stories.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
I made the acceptance tests and chose the mockups for the user stories:

 * #11 - [As a user, I want to export a specific PO items details, so that I can view all the items of a PO](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/issues/11)
 * #12 - [As a user, I want to export an ASN's item details, so that I can view all the details of a specific ASN](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/issues/12)
 * #15 - [As a user, I want to see the details of a PO, so that I can confirm the management of my order](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/issues/15)

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None were made during this sprint

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

- Took part in writing the e-mails to the PO, along with the other SPOs, that got us important information to enhance our vision of the product
- Participated in a 1h30 meeting with the other SPOs and PO, that led to a better organization of the user stories to be done in Sprint 1


## Sprint 1

During this sprint, I worked mostly on the [Inbound](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound)'s backend. Specifically, I helped create new GET and POST endpoints for the Purchase Orders and the ASNs, and did a lot of the necessary work for those endpoints to come to life. I also reviewed some of my peers's code and helped with other problems that arised. I also took part in the constant communication with the Product Owner as SPO, including the demo presentation at the end of the Sprint.
