# Factsheet for JoÃ£o Mesquita

## Sprint 0

Along with the rest of team 1 I helped create the user stories for the inboud portion of the project.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I made the acceptance tests and chose the mockups for user story:

 * #7 - As a user, I want to be able to archive a specific PO, so that I can remove it from my active orders 
 * #8 - As a user, I want to see the details of a specific ASN, so that I can see its information

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None were made during this sprint

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of
1. Participated in a 1h30 meeting with the SPOs and PO, that led to a better organization of the User Stories to be done in Sprint 1
2. Participated in the starting boilerplate meeting to define the microservice template project
