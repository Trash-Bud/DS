  2. Helped others with any problem they had when making frontend related issues

## Sprint 3

This sprint I was tasked with refactoring some frontend widgets to eliminate dead and repeated code with the objective of fixing some exiting loading issues. Furthermore I also helped pagination and created the design-system service with the objective of keeping the design consistent across services. In this new service I also created four button types, headline types and color swatches. Finally I was tasked with creating a couple bug fixes.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I worked extensively on the user stories

 * #1 - [As a user I want the buttons across micro services to be consistent, so the buttons' functions and hierarchy is easier to understand across micro services](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/design-system/issues/1)

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

 * #3 - [Feature/buttons](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/design-system/pull/3)
 * #71 - [Feature/refactor fe](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/design-system/pull/3)

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

  1. Created the design-system service including its main README file for documentation
  2. Fixed various front end related bugs

## Sprint 4
In this sprint, I worked on the Design System making new widgets as well as on the Inbound by integrating it with the design system and making a couple contribution in fixing front end tests after pagination broke them.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * #10 [As a user I want the tabs across micro services to be consistent, so that the design is easier to understand ](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/design-system/issues/10)

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
 * #39 [Fix text size](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/design-system/pull/39)

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of
  1. Created and added a new runner to the repository.
  2. Helped fix some repository configuration issues in the design system

## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

During the elaboration of the project I was tasked with various refactoring tasks on the inbound micro service as well as the creation and maintenance of a custom runner so that Pull Requests could run actions that guaranteed code consistency and the correct working of the code.

### Product Realization

I contributed with many new features to the project mainly when it came to the frontend of the inbound microservice and the creation of various widgets in the design system repository.

### Value for the Client

The work made by me allows the client to visualize their purchase orders and ASNs as well as their details in the inbound micro service and furthermore it makes it possible to experience the aforementioned micro service in devices of various sizes while still maintaining usability as well as helping maintain visual consistency across different micro-services.
