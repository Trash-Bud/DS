# Factsheet for Victor Nunes

## Sprint 0

Along with the rest of team 2, I helped to create some user stories for the catalog part of the project.
I also participated in the creation of mockups for the user stories.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I helped in the creation the following user stories

 * [#3](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/3) - As a brand, I want to edit my product so that I can change its information.
 * [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/5) - As a brand, I want to archive a product of my catalog so that I can keep the catalog up-to-date.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None were done in this sprint.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

 * Participation in online meetings of the group
 * Participation on the creation of some user stories



## Sprint 1

I made the frontend page of the products list, with its products, using the Flutter framework as it was requested by the PO. After that, [Bruno Mendes](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/blob/develop/factsheets/Bruno_Mendes.md) did some improvements, implemented the MVC architecture and integrated it with the backend.
With the rest of team 2, I helped to improve the user stories of the catalog, so that they became more clear.

### The user stories that I am most proud of

 * [#9](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/9) - As an admin, I want to see the list of products of the catalog so that I know which products are offered by the brands.

* [#16](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/16) - Add frontend for products list (no filter)


### The pull requests that I am most proud of

* [#32](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/32)

### Other contributions that I am especially proud of

 * Collaboration with group members, specially [Bruno Mendes](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/blob/develop/factsheets/Bruno_Mendes.md).
 * Helping [António Miranda](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/blob/develop/factsheets/Ant%C3%B3nio_Miranda.md) with some Docker related issues.


## Sprint 2

In this new sprint, we changed our approach from only products to products/variants, as it was requested by the PO. My work was mainly focused in the frontend, developping the product variants window, showing its information, doing the design made previously on Figma. I worked on it alongside [Henrique Nunes](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/blob/develop/factsheets/Henrique_Nunes.md).

### The user stories that I am most proud of

 * [#11](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/11) - As an admin, I want to see a product variant of the catalog and its properties so that I can see more detailed information about the product variant.


### The pull requests that I am most proud of

* [#57](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/57) - Feature/view product details

### Other contributions that I am especially proud of

 * Helping [António Miranda](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/blob/develop/factsheets/Ant%C3%B3nio_Miranda.md) with some issues during the class.
