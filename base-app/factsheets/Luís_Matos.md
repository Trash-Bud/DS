# Factsheet for LuÃ­s Matos

## Sprint 0

Participated in a meeting with the rest of team 4, that led to the creation of the user stories for the brand data configuration portion of the project.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I am proud to have contributed to the creation of these User Stories and its acceptance tests:

* [#2](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/2) - As an admin, I want to change a brand's policies for e-fulfillment so that it matches their preferences.
 * [#3](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/3) - As an admin, I want to change the warehouses that store a brand's products so that the brand's customers have a better delivery experience.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None were made during this sprint.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

## Sprint 1

In this sprint, I have contributed, along with some colleagues in my team, to the Kafka setup, leaving a good solution for this service so that the microservices can take benefit from it.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

Most of the effort was put into the Kafka setup leaving not enough time to finish any other User Story, but there was still progress in these:
* [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/microservice-template/issues/5) - Setup Kafka for the backend.
* [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/issues/13) - As a user, I want to book an ASN, so that a ReceptionCreated message is created and sent using KAFKA.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

* [#24](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/inbound/pull/24) - Setup Kafka.

## Sprint 2

In this sprint our development with Kafka was limited, so I decided to help other teams with their User Stories. I collaborated with team 3 [Brand-Configs](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs).

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

* [#41](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/41) - As an admin, I want to create a brand with a certain configuration and contact information, so that a new brand can be represented accurately.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

Participation in a meeting organized by the PO to solve the Kafka previous issues.

## Sprint 4

In this sprint, there were only 2 User Stories Kafka-related. So, during this sprint, I decided to collaborate with team 3 [Brand-Configs](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs), just like in sprint 2, giving my previous work continuation by being responsible for the brand edit form. I also enhanced the create brand pop-up by allowing the contact info to be deletable.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

* [#79 - As an Admin, I want to be able to edit a brand's info.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/79)
* [#75 - Make contact info in the create brand form deletable.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/brand-configs/issues/75)
