# Factsheet for Pedro Machado

## Sprint 0

Together with team 3, we developed the user stories for the project's base App.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I am proud to have contributed to the creation of these user stories:

- [#1 - As a User, I want to be able to toggle in between the multiple microservices, so that I may access their services when needed](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/issues/1)
- [#2 - As User, I want to be able to log in so that I have access to the rest of the base app.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/issues/2)


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests have been made during this sprint.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library.
