# Factsheet for Team 3

## Sprint 0

The team was responsible for the creation of the three user stories related to the Base App portion of the project.

### The four user stories that we are most proud of

Only three user stories were created, seeing as the base app is a relatively simple component (we are still very proud of all of them):

- [#1 - As a User, I want to be able to toggle in between the multiple microservices, so that I may access their services when needed](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/issues/1)
- [#2 - As User, I want to be able to log in so that I have access to the rest of the base app.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/issues/2)
- [#3 - As an Admin, I want to be able to see a list of brands, so that I may be aware of what clients use our system.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/base-app/issues/3)
