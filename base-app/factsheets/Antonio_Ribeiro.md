# Factsheet for Antonio Ribeiro

## Sprint 0

Along with the rest of team 1 I helped create the user stories for the inboud portion of the project.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I made the acceptance tests and chose the mockups for user story:

 * #5 As a user, I want to cancel a PO, so that I can cancel an order I made.
 * #6 As a user, I want to search for a specific PO, so that I can efficiently find the order I'm looking for.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None were made during this sprint.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

## Sprint 3

During the sprint, I was assigned to the frontend of the following issue (#58, "As a user, I want to have pagination in the tables, so that I can quickly navigate in them"), that implemented the frontend part of the pagination. Unfortunately, due to a bad time management on my part and some other technical issues (testing implementation), the PR was made relatively close to the deadline, which lead to other problems. The github action's time expired in the morning, and the PR was not merged into the develop branch. In class, we were supposes to merge it, however the following ensued:

From today's meeting (24/11), we realized that the current pagination behaviour is not what was desired by the PO (infinite scroll), and needs to be coherent with the variant's catalog page (that uses the Pager widget). It was then decided that this issue would be backlogged again and refactored in the sprint 4, where a system design implementation for paginated widgets will be created simultaneously.
