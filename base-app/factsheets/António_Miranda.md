# Factsheet for António Miranda

## Sprint 0

As a member of team 2, I participated in the creation of the user stories for the 'catalog'.
I also come up with several questions related to the catalog to be asked to the PO. Changes
were made to the user stories to comply with the answers provided and PO sent part of the
questions to other people within Maersk to get more answers.
I create the mockups related to the users stories that I refined following my coleagues examples.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I was responsible for the acceptance tests and mockups of these user stories:

 * #3 - [As a brand, I want to edit my product so that I can change its information.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/3)
 * #5 - [As a brand, I want to archive a product of my catalog so that I can keep the catalog up-to-date.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/5)

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None were made during this sprint.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

I also give contributions for the market analysis and for the domain analysis.

## Sprint 1

Participated in the development of the Working Item [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8), related to the User Story [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/21). Explored alone different ways of implementing the drag & drop functionality. Shared knowledge and discussed with a team mate what would be the best way to implement that functionality. We engaged in peer programming until we got a first version of this functionality.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

In this sprint I only worked on this user story:

 * #8 [As a brand, I want to import a list of variants in a .xlsx file so that I can insert variants in the catalog that are already listed in a template format.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8)


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

A commit of the 'current version' of the Work Item [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8) has been made but was not merged into the default branch which, at the time of the commit was already closed for the sprint 1.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

In this sprint I faced some technical difficulties that negatively impacted the pace of development of my work. Those problems were solved and the system was improved in a way that makes these kinds of technical issues either unlikely to occur or with much faster solutions. Also helped a colleague to solve technical issues.


## Sprint 2

Continued the development of the Working Item [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8), along with [Flávio](https://github.com/wolfCuanhamaRWS) and with [Henrique](https://github.com/Rikenunes8) who, once again, was always available to help us on the toughtest parts.
Suggested improvements in comparison with the proposed mockup which were implemented, and coded part of its formating and functionalities.


### The user story that I am most proud of

 * #8 [As a brand, I want to import a list of variants in a .xlsx file so that I can insert variants in the catalog that are already listed in a template format.](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/8)


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

 * [#70](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/70) Feature/import xlsx

 * [#67](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/67) Feature/send file 

### Other contributions that I am especially proud of

Spend time analyzing frontend and backend code of the catalog so I could learn more and thus improve my skill and hability to contribute to the project through the next sprints.

## Sprint 3

Worked on unit and integrations tests [#89](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/issues/89). These tests are related to a popup whose fields are filled according to the item clicked on a previous page. Thus, the test is less straightforward as other tests of 'normal pages'. Did as much as I could by myself and close to the end, receive help of my colleague [Bruno Mendes](https://github.com/bdmendes) who worked in pair programming with me as the driver. This pair programming was important not only to get familiar with the last changes of the backend server but also to acquire more general knowledge about programming and debugging. 

### The pull request that I am most proud of


 * [#70](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC01/catalog/pull/111) First tests on 'add_variant_popup'.


### Other contributions that I am especially proud of

Identified a pixel overflow error in the page 'edit products/variants' that was temporarily fixed with a workaround until one more experienced colleague ([Bruno Mendes](https://github.com/bdmendes)) could provide a definitive fix.
Suggested small improvements on that page that maybe implemented during the next sprint.
